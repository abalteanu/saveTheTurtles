The ultimate test of man's conscience may be his 
willingness to sacrifice something today for future
generations whose words of thanks will not be heard.
-Gaylord Nelson
RULES
Welcome to SAVE THE TURTLES!
Your job is to, quite simply, save the turtles by collecting the
garbage from the sea!
Aim, then press the down arrow key to fish into the ocean.
Catch the most garbage possible in 30 seconds!
Garbage deeper in the ocean is worth more points!
GOOD LUCK!
